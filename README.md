# Fake it to Make it

[Presentation at the F# Sydney meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fsharpsydney/events/235632235/).

Could the consume, build, and ship process be made simpler? With Paket and Fake it certainly can be! Within my day job at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), we use Paket and Fake extensively for the build-deploy side of the Elastic .Net clients and MSI installers. 

Pretty much, Steffen Forkman forked the .Net build ecosystem when he created Paket and Fake. We think forked for the better and in this talk, I'm going to show you why.
